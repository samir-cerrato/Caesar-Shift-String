# Caesar-Shift-String
A program to perform a Caesar shift on a string of characters.

Have your program first read in the string to be
shifted, and then read in the amount to shift by. Your program should then compute and output
the shifted string. In the string, the user can include any ASCII character with decimal code in the
range [32,126]. This range determines the range of shifts permitted: shift amounts from 0 to 126-32 = 94 are all permitted. You may assume that the user will enter a string of at most 256 characters,
including the newline character. While most of the work
for your program will be done in the main function, you must write at least one function that is
responsible for performing a Caesar shift. That function might return the result of shifting a single
character, or it might shift many characters in a single call.
